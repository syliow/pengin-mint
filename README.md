<!-- Pengin Club is my first personal NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection. I'm really interested in Ethereum and blockchain technology. So I decided to create a Pengin NFT collection and Pengin Club website as my portfolio. -->

## Why Solidity? 
- I decided to use Solidity because it's one of the more popular programming languages for developing smart contracts. It's also very versatile, which means I can create a wide variety of contracts and applications with it.

## How to own a Pengin NFT? 
1. To get started with Pengin Club, you first need to download the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension. Metamask is a secure crypto wallet that allows you to easily interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Once you have Metamask installed, you can visit the [Pengin Club NFT Mint](https://pengin-nftmint.netlify.app/) and click on "Connect" in the top right corner. From there, you'll be prompted to sign in with an existing metamask account.
3. Once you're logged in, enter the quantity and click the "Mint" button. A metamask prompt will require you to pay the gas fee to complete the transaction.
4. Please wait a while for the network to confirm your transaction and your Pengin NFT will be minted.
5. Congratulations. You are now officially a Pengin Club member!

## Installation

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/syliow/pengin-nft-minting-website.git` command.
